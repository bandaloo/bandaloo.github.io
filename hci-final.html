        Welcome to my HCI project gallery! You can preview, read about and even
        play many of the team projects we produced over the course of the term.

        For each of the listed projects, I have provided a button that links to
        the Medium blog post. For two of the projects, you can click the "play"
        button to interact with them directly.  I hope you enjoy browsing some
        of the neat projects we had the opportunity to create!

        <h2>
        A Little About Myself
        </h2>

        <p>
        I am a computer science student at WPI with a wide range of interests.
        Unsurprisingly, I'm a big fan of computers. I love to program,
        especially when it relates to graphics and game development. I have
        also always been interested in graphic design, art and animation. I'm
        always trying to learn new things and explore the ways I can apply my
        knowledge. This website is an example of that. Once you're done with
        this page, I hope you take the opportunity to explore the rest of this
        site and check out my GitHub. Anyway, I hope you have fun!
        </p>

        Design For Others
        </h2>
        <p>
        In this project, we were tasked with designing a mobile site for a given
        demographic. We used multiple tools to prototype and refine the design.

        <h2>
        Design For Understanding
        </h2>
        <p>
        This project tasked us with building a "clear" visualization and a
        "creative" visualization. I worked on the "creative" side, programming and
        designing a 3D globe to visualize earthquakes using the p5 library.

        <h2>
        Design For Tension
        </h2>
        <p>
        In this project, we had to design an argumentative chatbot that allowed a user
        to engage in a debate to explore a topic. We had a lot of fun injecting
        our bot with humor, and learned a lot about the relatively unexplored art of
        building a chat-based interface.

        <h2>
        Design For Well-being
        </h2>
        <p>
        This project allowed us to consider how an "emotionally aware" piece of software
        might change the experience. We leveraged this idea to create a pretty goofy
        game. You can play an abridged version of that game right here on this site.
