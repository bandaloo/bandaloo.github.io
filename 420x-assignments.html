      <h2>Aesthetic and Technical Intent</h2>
      <p>
        I really like the Conway's Game of Life. It is still astounding to me
        that a simple, completely deterministic system can produce so much
        complexity. If you are ever bored and suspect you have similar
        inclinations to me, I recommend checking out
        <a href="LifeWiki">LifeWiki</a>. People are still studying this
        zero-player game and learning more about it. I suppose any system that
        is Turing-complete could be studied forever, so perhaps it's no
        surprise!
      </p>
      <p>
        You might already be familiar with the rules: a cell is born if it has
        two neighbors, and stays alive if it has two three neighbors. Otherwise,
        it dies. The
        <a href="https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Rulestring">rulestring</a> for
        this is <code>B3/S23</code> As you might imagine, there are many
        rulestrings you could come up with: 4 <sup>9</sup> or 262144 to be
        exact. In my version, rule <code>B3/S23</code> looks like row 3 checked
        in the dead column, and 2 and 3 checked in the alive column. So,
        Conway's Game of Life is really a small part of the other cellular
        automata (or <a href="https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/OCA">OCA</a>) that
        can exist. I have created a tool that allows you to explore this
        possibility space in the past. However, this old web toy runs on the
        CPU, so I was not able to animate a massive grid in real time. The UI I
        originally came up with was somewhat unintuitive as well, so this is
        something I wanted to improve on.
      </p>
      <p>
        I called my new web toy "Games of Lives Maker" but even this is somewhat
        of a misnomer. It is a tool to create and share any cellular automata
        where cells are born and die based on the number of alive neighbors in
        the
        <a href="https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Moore_neighbourhood"
          >Moore neighborhood</a
        >. It covers any OCA that can be defined by the typical B/S rulestring
        notation.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are plenty of tools that allow you to run cellular automata. These
        are parallelized and optimized to a ridiculous degree, no doubt also
        taking advantage of the GPU. Since tools to study Conway's Game of Life
        and other cellular automata is well-covered, it doesn't make sense to
        compete with this by trying to develop a fully-featured suite for
        studying cellular automata. Therefore, the aesthetic intent of my
        project is more important. I allow the user to color the simulation in
        interesting ways. I didn't want to simply wash over the white cells with
        a crazy pattern arbitrarily; it was important to me that the coloring
        reflected some aspect of the simulation. Alive cells blend between the
        "young color" and "old color" as they age. This means that
        <a href="https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Still_life">still lifes</a>
        will fade to one color as they age, which separates them visually from
        the cells that are constantly in flux. Similarly, dead cells will leave
        behind a "trail color" which will slowly fade into the "dead color."
        This post-processing reveals additional patterns that are not apparent
        with simple 1-bit color. Take this simple black-and-white example with
        no-gradient for
        <a
          href="https://www.bandaloo.fun/golm/?y=ffffff&o=ffffff&t=000000&d=000000&r=333201113"
          >this ruleset</a
        >. While this looks chaotic and is difficult to watch, add the right
        colors and
        <a
          href="https://www.bandaloo.fun/golm/?y=0152f3&o=00fdfe&t=0000ff&d=0f1bff&r=333201113"
          >moving blobs are revealed</a
        >. Because I see this toy as more of a creative tool, I wanted people to
        be able to easily share rulesets and color schemes, so I included the
        shareable link that puts the colors and rules into a query string at the
        end of the url. I have probably spent just as much time coding this tool
        as I have playing with the rules and colors to create some generated
        art; because of this, I feel as though I have succeeded with my
        aesthetic intent. I have saved and cropped dozens of pictures to post to
        social media. I hope people have close to as much fun as I did creating
        interesting imagery with this tool.
      </p>
      <h2>Reaction to Feedback</h2>
      <p>
        I shared "Games of Lives Maker" with friends and family. My brother was
        surprised with the variety of creations you could attain by tweaking the
        rules and colors. He mentioned that this web toy did a good job of
        giving a sense of scale, since you could scroll around or zoom out to
        see all the cells being simulated at once (of which there are over two
        million.) My friend also had a chance to play with the web toy. He had
        the idea of including a button that completely randomizes the rules and
        colors. That way, it would automate the process of randomly changing the
        parameters in hopes of stumbling across an interesting ruleset. I will
        probably continue to add features in the future. I also dropped the link
        on Twitter and got a couple of these: Ô∏è&#10084;&#65039; but I didn't get
        too many comments.
      </p>
      <h2>Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        One of the challenges was passing the "rules" of the cellular automata
        down to the GPU. I encoded the rules as a list of nine integers, and
        created a uniform for this. The rule array for Conway's Game of Life
        looks like this: <code>[0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]</code>. For example,
        a cell that has three neighbors would index the third (or fourth, if
        counting from one) item in this array, and find rule 3, which indicates
        that alive cells should stay alive and dead cells should come to life. I
        only pass the rules down to the GPU once they have changed to avoid any
        uneccessary communication between the CPU and the GPU. This kind of
        works out elegantly, because the pair of checkboxes in the GUI
        represents the "rule" number in binary. Unfortunately, you cannot index
        an array by a non-constant in WebGL. To get around this, I have to
        iterate up to the desired index. I'm sure Khronos had good reason for
        this, and I'm sure it's optimization, but annoyingly, this means the
        "worst case" scenario is when each cell has eight neighbors. This is
        only really annoying from a theoretical perspective, since the
        simulation runs smoothly, and this worst case doesn't typically
        manifest. (In retrospect, instead of using an array, I could have stored
        all of the rules in a single integer uniform, since you only need 18
        bits to store the rules. However, this would have made the simulation
        shader more complicated, as I would somehow need to extract the rules
        from this integer. I wonder if you could "index" a pair of bits in an
        integer by dividing and rounding somehow? This would probaby be pretty
        fast.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I avoided dat.gui because I wanted slightly greater control over the UI,
        both aesthetically and mechanically. This took some time to get right.
        The main reason for this is that I'm not sure how you might accomplish
        the "rules table" part of the GUI with dat.gui alone. To keep things
        simple, I kept all of the GUI stuff in a separate module that gets
        bundled in the build process.
      </p>
      <p>
        I originally worked off of the in-class Game of Life tutorial. However,
        almost all of it had to be rewritten to accomodate for generalized
        rulesets.
      </p>
      <p>
        The data for the state of the simulation is stored in a single pixel.
        The red channel is either 1.0 or 0.0 representing whether the cell is
        alive or dead. The blue channel is used to store the age of an alive
        cell, while the green channel is used to store the age of a dead cell.
        (This is actually somewhat redundant; I could have simply stored the age
        in one channel, since red already denotes whether the cell is alive or
        dead. This info could even be reduced to a single channel.) The
        simulation is not rendered based on these colors, however. The
        `render.glsl` shader takes these values and uses them to mix between the
        user defined colors for alive cells and dead cells. I was able to avoid
        branching in the render shader.
      </p>
      <h2>Cool Patterns</h2>
      <p>
        I found a bunch of weird rulesets and nice color schemes just by messing
        around. Click on these links to see some of them. (Remember you can
        scroll around or change the scale!)

      <h1>Assignment 4 - Simulation Programming</h1>
      <p>
        I chose to implement a rock paper scissors cellular automata that runs
        on the GPU.
        <a href="gpu-rps/gpu-rps.html">Click here to play it.</a> You can find
        the code
        <a href="https://github.com/bandaloo/gpu-rps">here.</a>
      </p>
      <h2>Aesthetic Intent</h2>
      <p>
        When I was browsing the web for an interactive version of this cellular
        automata, strangely enough, there were very few examples.
        Coincidentally, the top result was an implementation by my friend Joe
        that can not run at full speed in real time because it runs on the CPU.
        You can play it <a href="https://josephpetitti.com/rps">here.</a> Once a
        few thousand cells are on the screen, the simulation will run at two
        frames per second or less. (Joe wrote this almost two years ago so it's
        not very fair to criticize; the point is that this is the first
        interactive example that appears when you Google "rock paper scissors
        cellular automata.") There are not many web-based implementations. You
        could argue that this form of cellular automata is not really
        established, as it doesn't even have its own Wikipedia page. Therefore,
        my implementation probably varies rule-wise compared to others,
        especially with regard to how fuel is spent per-cell. One thing that is
        not intuitive about the way this simulation is usually presented is that
        each cell has a hidden "fuel" value. This is why a single cell won't
        consume the entire screen, but will instead stop eventually. I wanted to
        visualize this by representing fuel as the brightness of the cell,
        making the simulation both easier to understand and more interesting to
        look at. I also wanted to have a very minimalist UI that could be easily
        hidden. With the controls, you can place red, green and blue cells,
        erase cells in a large rectangle, or clear the screen. The goal was not
        to create a software suite to tweak every variable of this simulation.
        Instead, I wanted to create a relatively simple web toy using this
        interesting cellular automata that people do not often discuss alongside
        the famous cellular automata, such as Conway's Game of Life or Rule 110.
      </p>
      <h2>Reaction to Feedback</h2>
      <p>
        Nick Krichevsky was kind enough to give me feedback on my project, even
        though he had already received feedback on his. He mentioned that he
        liked the concept of cells eating other cells. Nick suggested that I
        should include a dot underneath the cursor so the user knows what color
        they have selected. I liked that idea so I implemented that change. Nick
        also sent me a screenshot displaying a possible bug, where very dark
        cells (meaning they were nearly out of fuel) consumed an entire field of
        green cells. I explained that this is actually intended behavior, as
        eating another cell does not spend fuel, but, expanding to an empty
        space does. However, this is something to keep in mind, since this kind
        of behavior might be counterintuitive.
      </p>
      <h2>Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        In order to get acquainted with <code>glslify</code>, I took Charlie
        Robert's game of life tutorial and pulled out the three shaders we used
        to run the simulation. I also added type information in jsdoc comments
        in order to help myself understand how the front buffer and back buffer
        were set up, and what kind of WebGL objects were being passed around. I
        built off of this to create my rock paper scissors shader. The fuel each
        cell has left is represented by the brightness of the color. This gives
        the gradient effect as cells spread out, and keeps things simple because
        I can step the simulation solely based on the contents of the buffer,
        much like game of life. In order to avoid any floating point errors, I
        reduced the fuel of each cell by increments of 1/64, or 0.015625 each
        time. One major difference between this simulation and Game of Life is
        that psuedo-randomness is used. I modified the
        <code>rand</code> function from The Book of Shaders in order to get an
        integer from 0 to 7. This choice determines from what direction each
        cell will be attacked by. I used branching but I'm sure it's possible to
        eliminate this. Even still, I was impressed with how fast the simulation
        was able to run. At 1920 by 1080 (the resolution of my second monitor)
        2,073,600 cells are being simulated every step!

      <h1>Mini Project 3 - Reaction Diffusion with GUI</h1>

      <h1>Mini Project 2 - Cellular Automata</h1>
      <p>
        I made the board wrap like a torus. It's hard to tell until you reach a
        steady state; then you can see evidence of it. I also attempted to make
        things more visually interesting by using color. The red channel is
        simply used to tell if the cell is alive or dead. The blue channel grows
        to 1.0 as the alive cell gets older. Dead cells make the empty cell
        green, which slowly fades away. This leaves a cool trail for things like
        gliders. <a href="gol-shader/gol_shader.html">You can see it here.</a>

      <h2>Aesthetic Intent</h2>
      <p>
        I got to play with the Vidiot, which is an analog video synthesizer. I
        spent my timeslot in the lab with Alex and Alp. Below are some of the
        pictures we captured of the video output.
      </p>
      <div style="width: 560px" class="center">
        <img src="images/pink-rows.jpg" class="blogimage" /><img />
        <img src="images/blue-yellow-ladders.jpg" class="blogimage" /><img />
        <img src="images/blue-orange-columns.jpg" class="blogimage" /><img />
        <img
          src="images/orange-blue-checkerboard.jpg"
          class="blogimage"
        /><img />
      </div>
      <p>
        I was particularly inspired by the picture directly above. The color
        inversions combined with square waves created a complex checkerboard
        effect. If you want to try to recreate this effect, the patches look
        something like this:
      </p>
      <div style="width: 560px" class="center">
        <img src="images/vidiot-patches.jpg" class="blogimage" /><img />
      </div>
      <p>
        In designing my shader, my goal was not necessarily to recreate this
        pattern. Instead, I wanted to play with the idea of creating grid-like
        patterns by inverting the luma and colors with square waves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because part of the joy of playing with the Vidiot involves twiddling
        the knobs and watching the output in real time, I decided that I wanted
        to make it easy for someone to manipulate my shader to get new effects.
        This is why I decided to include sliders on the web page that
        manipulated various uniforms in the GLSL code.
      </p>
      <p>
        The square waves allow the user to invert the color and luma of the
        underlying sin waves. What is nice about this is that complementary
        colors are always on the screen. It is easier than it might seem to
        create an aesthetically pleasing color scheme. You can change the
        frequency of both the sine and square waves in either the x or y
        direction. I locked these sliders to integers because this makes it
        easier to line up the wavelengths to create a symmetrical pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is also a rolling noise effect that is masked off by a triangle
        wave. You can control the speed and size of this, or get rid of it
        altogether by zeroing out the sliders. I was inspired by the effect you
        get when you attempt to film a CRT screen.
      </p>
      <h2>Reaction to Feedback</h2>
      <p>
        Cem noticed that I was able to recreate some of the vertical and
        horizontal patterns we achieved while playing with the Vidiot in the
        lab. He also mentioned that it would be interesting if you were able to
        create a zooming effect with the sliders.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was glad to hear that Alex had fun playing around with the sliders to
        change the pattern. He mentioned that a tool like this could be used to
        ease a beginner into video synthesizers since the Vidiot can be somewhat
        unintuitive. I was worried that the tool wouldn't be too limited in
        regard to customizability to be fun. But, even with the limited amount
        of parameters he mentioned was able to create a nice variety of images.
        In fact, he liked simplicity with its focus on square waves and sine
        waves. Alex mentioned that it would be nice to be able to see the
        numerical output of the slider, making it easier to save your design.
        This gave me the idea that this kind of tool might benefit from the
        ability to download and upload sets of parameters. The feedback I got
        was great, and I hope I was as helpful to Alex and Cem as they were to
        me.

        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>
          My main goal for this shader was to practice using various techniques
          from the early chapters of <i>The Book of Shaders</i>, such as shaping
          functions and basic shapes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Early on, I wrote a function that produced a slanted wave-like effect.
          I parameterized this function and learned that I could create a
          variety of distinct effects with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also had a lot of fun using basic shapes to create masks for more
          complex patterns. I used blurry rectangles to mask off different
          versions of the wave-like effect, creating a sort of gallery of
          slightly different framed animations.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the end of the process, I went for a bright but restricted color
          scheme using a distance field to create a subtle purple glowing
          effect. Originally, I intended to only work in monochrome. By the end
          of the Overlapping the wavy rectangles was the final addition. I
          discovered the overlapping effect purely by accident. The rectangles
          start still, and slowly begin to rotate around one another, speeding
          up over time until the max speed is reached.
        </p>
        <h2>Reaction to Feedback</h2>
        <p>
          Alex Osner was kind enough to give feedback on my shader. To be
          honest, I did not think about what mood or theme the animation should
          convey. At the same time, I was happy to hear my animation gave off an
          eerie feeling based on the colors and the movement of the shapes. Alex
          also mentioned that the color choice had a "vaporwave" aesthetic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alex also remarked on an optical illusion that was happening due to
          the movement of the three vertical bars of waves. As the animation
          progresses, the bars move horizontally out of phase with one another
          in a sine wave. This gave the effect that the bars were moving in 3D
          space along a ground plane.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was pleased that Alex appreciated the repeating theme of three
          different vertical bars with a similar pattern. Like Alex, I thought
          one of the most interesting aspects was how the bars blended together
          while overlapping.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, this type of feedback was excellent. Alex has already given
          me ideas for techniques I want to experiment with in future shaders.
          The code for the shader is
          <a href="https://github.com/bandaloo/shaders">in this repo</a> in
          "wave-windows.frag".
