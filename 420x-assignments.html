      <h2>Aesthetic Intent</h2>
      <p>
        I got to play with the Vidiot, which is an analog video synthesizer. I
        spent my timeslot in the lab with Alex and Alp. Below are some of the
        pictures we captured of the video output.
      </p>

        <img

          class="blogimage"
        /><img />
      </div>
      <p>
        I was particularly inspired by the picture directly above. The color
        inversions combined with square waves created a complex checkerboard
        effect. If you want to try to recreate this effect, the patches look
        something like this:
      </p>
      <div style="width: 560px" class="center">
        <img src="images/vidiot-patches.jpg" class="blogimage" /><img />
      </div>
      <p>
        In designing my shader, my goal was not necessarily to recreate this
        pattern. Instead, I wanted to play with the idea of creating grid-like
        patterns by inverting the luma and colors with square waves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because part of the joy of playing with the Vidiot involves twiddling
        the knobs and watching the output in real time, I decided that I wanted
        to make it easy for someone to manipulate my shader to get new effects.
        This is why I decided to include sliders on the web page that
        manipulated various uniforms in the GLSL code.
      </p>
      <p>
        The square waves allow the user to invert the color and luma of the
        underlying sin waves. What is nice about this is that complementary
        colors are always on the screen. It is easier than it might seem to
        create an aesthetically pleasing color scheme. You can change the
        frequency of both the sine and square waves in either the x or y
        direction. I locked these sliders to integers because this makes it
        easier to line up the wavelengths to create a symmetrical pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is also a rolling noise effect that is masked off by a triangle
        wave. You can control the speed and size of this, or get rid of it
        altogether by zeroing out the sliders. I was inspired by the effect you
        get when you attempt to film a CRT screen.
      </p>
      <h2>Reaction to Feedback</h2>
      <p>
        Cem noticed that I was able to recreate some of the vertical and
        horizontal patterns we achieved while playing with the Vidiot in the
        lab. He also mentioned that it would be interesting if you were able to
        create a zooming effect with the sliders.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was glad to hear that Alex had fun playing around with the sliders to
        change the pattern. He mentioned that a tool like this could be used to
        ease a beginner into video synthesizers since the Vidiot can be somewhat
        unintuitive. I was worried that the tool wouldn't be too limited in
        regard to customizability to be fun. But, even with the limited amount
        of parameters he mentioned was able to create a nice variety of images.
        In fact, he liked simplicity with its focus on square waves and sine
        waves. Alex mentioned that it would be nice to be able to see the
        numerical output of the slider, making it easier to save your design.
        This gave me the idea that this kind of tool might benefit from the
        ability to download and upload sets of parameters. The feedback I got
        was great, and I hope I was as helpful to Alex and Cem as they were to
        me.

      <h1>Assignment 2 - Shader Live Coding</h1>
      <div style="text-align: left">
        <iframe
          class="center"
          width="560"
          height="315"
          src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EmkmgNOJ9HY"

          allowfullscreen
        ></iframe>

        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>
          My main goal for this shader was to practice using various techniques
          from the early chapters of <i>The Book of Shaders</i>, such as shaping
          functions and basic shapes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Early on, I wrote a function that produced a slanted wave-like effect.
          I parameterized this function and learned that I could create a
          variety of distinct effects with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also had a lot of fun using basic shapes to create masks for more
          complex patterns. I used blurry rectangles to mask off different
          versions of the wave-like effect, creating a sort of gallery of
          slightly different framed animations.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the end of the process, I went for a bright but restricted color
          scheme using a distance field to create a subtle purple glowing
          effect. Originally, I intended to only work in monochrome. By the end
          of the Overlapping the wavy rectangles was the final addition. I
          discovered the overlapping effect purely by accident. The rectangles
          start still, and slowly begin to rotate around one another, speeding
          up over time until the max speed is reached.
        </p>
        <h2>Reaction to Feedback</h2>
        <p>
          Alex Osner was kind enough to give feedback on my shader. To be
          honest, I did not think about what mood or theme the animation should
          convey. At the same time, I was happy to hear my animation gave off an
          eerie feeling based on the colors and the movement of the shapes. Alex
          also mentioned that the color choice had a "vaporwave" aesthetic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alex also remarked on an optical illusion that was happening due to
          the movement of the three vertical bars of waves. As the animation
          progresses, the bars move horizontally out of phase with one another
          in a sine wave. This gave the effect that the bars were moving in 3D
          space along a ground plane.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was pleased that Alex appreciated the repeating theme of three
          different vertical bars with a similar pattern. Like Alex, I thought
          one of the most interesting aspects was how the bars blended together
          while overlapping.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, this type of feedback was excellent. Alex has already given
          me ideas for techniques I want to experiment with in future shaders.
          The code for the shader is
          <a href="https://github.com/bandaloo/shaders">in this repo</a> in
          "wave-windows.frag".
