        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>
          My main goal for this shader was to practice using various techniques
          from the early chapters of <i>The Book of Shaders</i>, such as shaping
          functions and basic shapes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Early on, I wrote a function that produced a slanted wave-like effect.
          I parameterized this function and learned that I could create a
          variety of distinct effects with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also had a lot of fun using basic shapes to create masks for more
          complex patterns. I used blurry rectangles to mask off different
          versions of the wave-like effect, creating a sort of gallery of
          slightly different framed animations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally, I intended to only work in monochrome. By the end of the
          process, went for a bright but restricted color scheme, using a
          distance field to create a subtle purple glowing effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally, I intended to only work in monochrome. By the end of the
          Overlapping the wavy rectangles was the final addition. I discovered
          the overlapping effect purely by accident. The rectangles start still,
          and slowly begin to rotate around one another, speeding up over time
          until the max speed is reached.
        </p>
        <h2>Reaction to Feedback</h2>
        <p>
          Alex Osner was kind enough to give feedback on my shader. To be
          honest, I did not think about what mood or theme the animation should
          convey. At the same time, I was happy to hear my animation gave off an
          eerie feeling based on the colors and the movement of the shapes. Alex
          also mentioned that the color choice had a "vaporwave" aesthetic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alex also remarked on an optical illusion that was happening due to
          the movement of the three vertical bars of waves. As the animation
          progresses, the bars move horizontally out of phase with one another
          in a sine wave. This gave the effect that the bars were moving in 3D
          space along a ground plane.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was pleased that Alex appreciated the repeating theme of three
          different vertical bars with a similar pattern. Like Alex, I thought
          one of the most interesting aspects was how the bars blended together
          while overlapping.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, this type of feedback was excellent. Alex has already given
          me ideas for techniques I want to experiment with in future shaders.
          The code for the shader is
          <a href="https://github.com/bandaloo/shaders">in this repo</a> in
          "wave-windows.frag".
