        merge-pass is a package that lets you easily create post-processing
        effects without a lot of graphics knowledge. it is kind of like a
        preprocessor for glsl, but it is also more than that. you specify a list
        of effects and merge-pass will create a single shader or a tree of
        shaders. it will manage texture swaps and program switching for you; all
        you need to do is give a high-level description of the effect. if you
        use typescript, there's a very good chance the shaders will compile if
        your typescript compiles. however, you can totally use this with just
        javascript as well. here's the

        this function returns an object containing the merger and a function
        that changes uniforms on every step. the important code that defines the
        actual effect is in <em>red</em>
