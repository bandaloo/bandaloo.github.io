      <h2>About Color Match</h2>

        <p>
        You've probably already figured out the basics. You click colors and they
        clear and eventually it gets hard and the blocks overflow.
        The score for each clear is calculated as an arithmetic sequence. For example,
        if you cleared three blocks at once, you would get 10 + 20 + 30 = 60 points.
        So, the best way to get a ton of points is to make really big combos by
        focusing on one color for a while until it is impossible to make more room.
        Here is an example of a pretty big combo:
        </p>
        <img src="images/combo-example.png" alt="a big combo"
        class="center" width=401 height=401>
        <p>
        Here I got 68 blue blocks together and cleared them for 28460 points.
        You'll notice I couldn't make this particular combo any bigger because
        the leftmost column was filled all the way up with blues.
        </p>
        <p>
        But, while you're building these big combos, you have to be smart about not
        making too many tiny moves. If you can, clear junk blocks in a way that let
        you clear more at once. The game doesn't get harder based on how many blocks
        you clear; it gets harder based on how many groups you clear. After enough
        clears, you'll be dealing with six colors and you'll only have two turns
        before a new row appears at the bottom.
        </p>
        <p>
        This is where the "rush blocks" button is pretty helpful. You can give
        yourself more blocks to work, and it doesn't count as a move. Therefore you
        can really take advantages of those early stages where you're only dealing
        with three or four colors.
        </p>
        <p>
        Even when you're dealing with lots of colors, you can still squeeze out a
        lot of points by thinking ahead and connecting large block groups by dropping
        the right columns.
        </p>
        <p>
        My high score is 59400 and I challenge everyone and anyone to beat it. It's
        a really good score. If you beat that score, email me at colegranof@gmail.com
        with a screenshot or recording or whatever. Even though it's pretty easy to
        cheat, I'll probably believe you since I'm not giving out prizes or anything
        so I don't see a lot of reason to cheat. (So please don't cheat.)
